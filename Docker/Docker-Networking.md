# Docker Networking: 

- **Docker networking is a crucial component for connecting and managing containers within a Docker environment.**
- **It enables communication between containers, between containers and the host system, and between containers and external networks.**


## Types of Docker Networks

### 1. Bridge Network

- **Default network type.**
- Connects containers on the same host.
- Suitable for simple applications needing container-to-container communication.

**Example:** Two containers on the same machine can talk to each other.
```sh
docker run -d --network bridge my-image
```

### 2. Host Network
- **Shares the host's network.**
- No network isolation.
- Ideal for high-performance applications needing low latency.
**Example:** A container uses the hostâ€™s network directly.
```sh
docker run -d --network host my-image
```
### 3. Overlay Network
- **Connects containers across multiple hosts.**
- Used in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes setups.
- Good for distributed applications.
**Example:** Services in a cluster communicate with each other.
```sh
docker network create --driver overlay my-overlay-network
```
### 4. Macvlan Network
- **Gives each container a unique MAC address.**
- Containers appear as physical devices on the network.
- Useful for legacy applications needing direct network access.
Example: Containers have their own IP addresses on the local network.
```sh
docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 -o parent=eth0 my-macvlan-network
```

### 5. None Network
- **No network access.**
- Completely isolates the container.
- Used for security-sensitive applications.
**Example:** A container runs without any network connection.
```sh
docker run -d --network none my-image
```


### Connect two Docker containers and verify their connectivity using ping
1. Create a Bridge Network:
   ```sh
   docker network create my-network
   ```
2. Run Container : Start the first container and connect it to the created network.
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name container1 --network my-network <image1>
   ```
3. Run Container : Start the second container and also connect it to the same network.
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name container2 --network my-network <image2>
   ```
4. Ping Between Containers: Now, you can enter either container and ping the other by its container name.
   ```sh
   docker exec -it container1 /bin/bash
   root@container1:/#apt update -y
   root@container1:/#apt instll iputils-ping -y
   root@container1:/#ping container2
  ```
